a) About how many hours did it take for you to implement this task?
~12 hours

b) What was your biggest challenge in implementing this task?
The biggest challenge is firstly learning how to navigate around Empirica, which uses both
an online interface to keep track of the experiment inputs and React to generate the content.
It is also challenging to learn new functions such as painting a canvas. Lastly, I had trouble
debugging because Empirica is a new app structure I have used, and I had a had time trying to 
debug independent of the Empirica app, and had to start a new instance(test) every time I debug.

c) What was a key design decision you made for this implementation?
I tried to organize the "functions" in a way that resembles object-oriented-programming,
with each function representing an object. This keeps the coding clean and makes object
perform its functionality.

d) (If unfinished) What do you plan to implement next?
Unfortunately, while debugging, I updated the React version to a newer version and re-installed 
some node modules. This made the whole app crash and is unable to start up. I wanted to use some
newer functionalities of React, such as useRef, which is only available in the later React version(s).
Hence, I will need to get the Empirica interface back up working. I also wanted to try debugging 
independent of the Empirica app so that I could make sure the interface is actually working, prior to 
deploying in Empirica.
